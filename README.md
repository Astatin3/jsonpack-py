# jsonpack

A JSON compression algorithm.

## Introduction

jsonpack is an algorithm for pack and unpack JSON data.
It can compress to 55% of original size if the data has a tree structure, example 
(http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/geojson/2.5/month)[Earthquake GeoJSON] or 
(http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=Twitter%20API&result_type=mixed)[Twitter Query API]. 

This lib is for the Web and node.js

```
// If you have a big json
var json = {...}

// Then, pack that 
var packed = jsonpack.pack(json);

...

// And then unpack that
var json = jsonpack.unpack(packed);
```
